HOW TO COMPILE:

As of now, there are 8 header files and 8 source files, organized into include and src folders respectively. There is also one file that has the main method,
called muondeflection.cc. To compile, sort the header files into the include folder and the source files into the src folder. Place both of these folders in a folder called muon_defelction. Now, navigate to the parent directory of muon_deflection and create a folder called muon_deflection_build. Ensure that the file CMakeLists.txt is in the muon_defelction folder. Run:

	$ cmake -DGeant4_DIR=/path_to_geant4_install_with_visualization/lib/Geant4-10.2.1 ../muon_deflection

Once the configure script has sucessfully completed, run the make utility.

HOW TO RUN:

Once the program has sucessfully compiled, you must create an initialization file. 

This is a csv style document. On one line, there should just be the variable name, followed by the value (no space).
The next variable should be on the next line and so on.

The other variables can be in any order, but must all be before the start of the position variables
The position variable should have x,y and z coordinates for each one of the modules you want to place.
The following is an example of what an initialization file would look like. The text in parentheses
is just comments and should not be included:

stripXYZ,10,1,1       (xyz dimension of a single strip)
numModules,2          (number of modules above the unknown object. The total number of modules will be 2x this number)
posXYZ,0,0,0          (position coordinates for each slab)
posXYZ,0,0,5

The position coordinates should only be for the modules above the unknown (positive Z). The program will mirror these coordinates for the
modules below (negative Z).

The position should be based on the geant4 coordinate system positions. This means that the exact 3-D center of the module will be located
at the points you specify.

ALL UNITS ARE IN CENTEMETERS

ENSURE THAT THE LONG DIMENSION FOR THE STRIP IS THE X DIMENSION.

Now run the program using the following command.

	$ ./muondeflection name_of_your_init_file



Also, ensure that the two macros, init_vis.mac and vis.mac are in the execution folder. They are necessary for visualization.


Once the program has started running, switch to the Geant4 console window. Type in the command:

/vis/viewer/set/viewpointThetaPhi 70 20

and hit enter. This will move the camera to a theta angle of 70 degrees and a phi angle of 20 degrees. This command can be used to move the camera to whatever angle is needed.
